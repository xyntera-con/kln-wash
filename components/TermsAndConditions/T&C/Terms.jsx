          specified location, we are deemed to have accepted the offer. There is

          your order between you and Kln Wash prior to our acceptance of your
          order. We will send you an electronic communication acknowledging
          receipt of your order, together with the services and quantities you
          chose, if your order is accepted.
        </p>
        <p>

          to it, the total value of the selected services will be charged to
          your payment card. Despite the aforementioned, the price you are
          charged for your chosen services within an order is subject to change
          in accordance with the conditions outlined below, and any additional
          amounts due as a result of such change shall also be charged to your
          payment card.

          of additional items in your order that were not accounted for in your
          initial order submission, taxes, service fees, and other applicable
          fees, prices for services shown on the Kln Wash website, or mobile
          application may differ from the prices actually assessed to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          A final updated total (including any applicable discounts, promotions,
          coupons (if available), substitutions, service fees, taxes, and other
          applicable fees) will be charged to your account within (48) hours of
          your order being delivered back to you. As a result, the total price
          you see when placing an order is only an estimate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never give money to a Kln Wash Provider/Partner directly. The client
          allows Kln Wash to charge his or her stored credit card for any
          additional services requested that are not part of the client&apos;s
          initial request. Invoices are processed in accordance with the payment
          conditions specified on the invoice, but payment must be received
          before the due date indicated on the invoice. In the case that an
          invoice is not fully paid, Kln Wash maintains the right, in its sole
          discretion, to suspend and/or terminate a customer&apos;s account and
          the services that will be offered to the customer. Both commercial and
          residential clients are subject to late fees and the termination or
          suspension of their accounts and services.

          Kln Wash may impose additional fees to cover any additional costs or
          servicing incurred by Kln Wash or a Kln Wash Provider/Partner as a
          result of a payment method being dishonored, denied, or otherwise
          unable to be completed (Payment &quot;Denial&quot;). After a
          customer&apos;s account has been suspended or terminated, any
          outstanding balance owed to Kln Wash will continue to be due and
          payable immediately.
        </p>
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <p>

          stated in this section. If no promotional value was received, a
          customer who has signed up for a prepaid package plan (laundry
          insurance) has the ability to cancel their contract within (14) days
          of signing up for the Kln Wash service and receive a full refund. Kln
          Wash shall have no duty to reimburse any sums paid by the customer
          after the fourteen-day grace period has passed. An order is considered
          final and the money is non-refundable if a promotional value was
          obtained.
        </p>
        <h3>Contaminated Items</h3>

          The client acknowledges that they won&apos;t put any of the following
          things inside their laundry bag 1. Non-washable items, 2. items marked
          for dry cleaning only, 3. items exposed to bedbugs, 4. items exposed
          to or in contact with bio-hazardous materials, such as feces, urine,
          blood, mold, mildew, lice, and other bugs, regardless of whether such
          contact or exposure caused visible symptoms, and 5. any other items
          not intended for laundering. Items that may have been exposed to bed
          bugs should be processed. Kln Wash reserves the right to charge for
          any goods or services required to minimize the harm done to the
          Provider&apos;s workspace, car, or physical body. This may include
          payment for the time necessary to fix the situation. If products are
          found to be contaminated during pre-processing, Kln Wash also retains
          the right to return them unprocessed and to levy a trip fee of ₦500.
        </p>
        <h3>Lost Items</h3>
        <p>
          Customers are required to notify us within five business days after
          the item&apos;s return in the unlikely event that something is
          misplaced. If an item is not delivered to the consumer within ten (10)
          days of the claim being filed, it is deemed lost. Any item that Kln
          Wash determines to be lost may be entitled to compensation up to the
          full value of the item. Utilizing the International Fair Claims Guide
          for Consumer Textiles Products, items will be assessed for
          depreciation. A receipt or other evidence of purchase is necessary. In
          any case, Kln Wash&apos;s total obligation is limited to the value of
          the lost item.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any lost or misplaced loose things, such as watches, jewelry,
          cufflinks, and other personal items that are not generally ordered
          with laundry services, are not the responsibility of Kln Wash. In
          addition, Kln Wash disclaims responsibility for lost merchandise both
          before and after delivery.

        <p>
          The laws of the State shall govern this Agreement in all aspects,
          including the arbitration clauses thereof. Any failure or delay in
          performance brought on by an event beyond either party&apos;s control,
          such as a war, an act of God, an earthquake, a riot, sabotage, a labor
          shortage or dispute, an interruption of the internet service, an act
          of government, or another similar occurrence, shall not subject either
          party to liability to the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or
          unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable and will not
          affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
          However, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in a
          manner to be effective and valid under any applicable law. Any right
          or condition of this Agreement that Kln Wash fails to execute or
          enforce shall not be deemed to have been waived by Kln Wash. Any
          waiver by Kln Wash of this Agreement must be made in writing and
          signed by a Kln Wash authorized representative.
        </p>
        <p>
          The terms of this Agreement replace all past or contemporaneous
          conversations and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written,
          between you and Kln Wash with regard to the subject matter hereof.
          Despite the aforementioned, you might also be subject to additional
          terms and conditions, posted policies (such as the Kln Wash Privacy
          Policy and the Kln Wash Application Addendum), guidelines, or rules
          that could still apply to you while using Kln Wash&apos;s websites,
          mobile applications, or other services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kln Wash may update this posting at any time to reflect changes to the
          Terms. You should periodically review the Terms to see if anything has
          changed. After any modifications have been made to the Terms, your
          continued use or use of the Kln Wash websites, mobile applications,
          content, or services denotes and acknowledges your acceptance of those
          modifications.
